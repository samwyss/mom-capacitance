\title{Approximating the Capacitance of Square Plates: A Method of Moments Convergence Study}

% I'm mashing some templates together here. If you write an actual IEEE transactions paper in LaTeX start from their template and then modify things like packages and files you want to include from there as opposed to starting from this document provided in this course.

\begin{abstract}
The Method of Moments (MoM) is applied to simulate the capacitance of an arbitrarily sized, square metallic plate. To model this system \textit{in silico}, the Electrostatic Integral Equation (EIE) is used to simulate the charge distribution for a fixed potential on the metallic plate. The total charge is then determined by integrating element-wise over the surface which is then used to solve for plate capacitance. This procedure is used to evaluate various formulations of the underlying integral equations from approximations of square elements, exact forms, to subdomain collocation. Capacitance values from these methods are first compared to data found in the literature as a verification and validation step and then compared to each other in terms of the mesh size required, and corresponding asymptotic number of operations, for these methods to achieve convergence.
